Amazon S3 has a feature to host static website.

  A static website is a website created using html,css and javascript. It doesnt require a backend or frontend. It's an easy route to create a website without any technical complexities.
I followed the following steps to host the website:

1. Create a bucket in Amazon S3
2.Upload the web files for the website (html,css and javascript) and the assets (e.g. images and videos)
3. After completion of the upload, change the bucket policy. Go to Bucket>>Permissions>>Bucket Policy
4. Edit the policy. I used this template :
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
5. I changed the arn/ Amazon Resource Name.
6.To enable static website hosting, i go to Properties>>Static Website Hosting
7. I enabled static website hosting, specify the index and error document and saved my changes.
8. I clicked on the bucket website endpoint, and checked if all is working.
9. My website was hosted successfulyy by Amazon S3.
