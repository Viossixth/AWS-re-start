## Introduction About Me

My tech journey started young Grade 4, to be exact. Researching unique geological formations on MS Word, navigating the early internet, fascinated by how technology connected information. That curiosity never left. I've watched tech evolve from Blackberries to smartphones, from data dongles to fiber internet. Now I'm not just watching I'm building, securing, and learning how to architect the cloud infrastructure that powers tomorrow.

I'm on a mission to enter the Cloud Security domain, combining infrastructure knowledge with security best practices to help organizations build resilient systems. Aspiring Cloud Professional focused implementing best practices across AWS environments. I believe technology isn't just about innovation,it's about securing that innovation. That's where I want to be. Dedicated. Hungry. Disciplined. I know dreams are a matter of time, and with patience and persistence, goals become reality.

## AWS re/Start Journey

Currently I am a Civil Engineering student with Unisa, but through curiosity I wanted to delve into tech. Engineering has shaped me to focus on the small details, to actively work as a collective and see the bigger picture when a problem arises. It's the communication, people skills and problem solving skills I want to bring over to my new path. I saw AWS re/Start as a stepping stone to build towards this new career path. AWS is a leading cloud cmputing company, with many organizations and companies integrating their workflow and needs with AWS. Competency with AWS services and technology will help me reach a good level of competency since many of the services we use daily are cloud based. A good understanding of cloud services will aid me in my jouney of entering cybersecurity.

**Key lessons and experiences**

Resilience and problem solving are two things I believed I've sharpened during the AWS re/Start programme. At times, a Lab or project might be difficult and time consuming but I held on persisted and thought of another angle and won. I learnt to work with people, to compromise and seek the outcome of the project not just my opinions on a matter. I also grew in confidence of my work and skills, my curiosity helped me take the first leap of trying to work with aws services, but the persistence and problem solving allowed me to continue on and through that process i gained confidence of my skills both individually and as a member of a group.

I acquired so much knowledge of cloud computing and basically peeled the layers of the internet infrastructure around us. I'm glad to say this is just the introduction, i'm aiming at learning more about cloud computing.

##  Key Projects

 **Project 1:
  Static restaurant Website hosted on S3**
  
This project attempts to create a digital presence for a restaurant with the aid of static website. The main aim of the project is to automate business operations through a reservation and order handling page. They key concept is intergrating the website with AWS services to achieve scalability and reliability. HTML, CSS and Javascript was used and integrated  seamlessly with Amazon S3 to host the website and accelerated with CloudFront, secured with SSL, and optimized for global performance using services within the AWS Free Tier.

 **Project 2: 3D Architecture**
 
The aim of this project was to design infrastructure for an ecommerce application or website which would have 3D Objects of their inventory. AWS services should be used for security, monitoring, performance and scalability. An infrstaructure diagram was drawn showing the various services used and the logical flow of information. A Project brief was written up explaining why each service was chosen and it's function, how the architecture meets the five requirements and any design trade-offs or challenges faced.
