**Overview**

To achieve this certificate, I had to access an AWS Environment where I had to create an IAM group for support engineers and attach EC2 read-only access policy to their group. I then had to create a user and attach them to the support engineers group and check if the policy works properly.
This was done in order to comply with the Principle of least privilledge and improving security controls. I gained hands on experience with IAM Users, IAM groups and EC2 policies. I learn of another way to protect EC2 instances by restricting access to them.

**Objectives**
* Compare IAM users, roles, and groups and their creation processes.
* Analyze the structure and components of IAM policies.
* Explain the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and compliance programs.
* Implement IAM best practices for secure access management.

**AWS Services**

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
* AWS Identity and Access Management
* Amazon Relational Database Service

**Overview**

To achieve this certificate, I had to log into the AWS Management Console provided with the aim of creating an Amazon RDS DB instance. I enabled backups for my database, enabled multi AZ deployment for Amazon RDS.
I also created an Amazon read replica. This was done to solve the insurance company database administrator's to spend less time in operational tasks and give them a database solution with high availability and efficiency.
I gained hands on experience with Amazon RDS, creating a DB instance and configuring Multi-AZ deployments and read replicas. I learnt of another way to improve DB performance by configuring a RDS Read replica and Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

**Objectives**

* Compare database types and their use cases on AWS.
* Implement Multi-AZ deployments for Amazon RDS high availability.
* Configure Amazon RDS read replicas for performance optimization.
* Differentiate between managed and hosted database solutions.
* Evaluate database migration strategies by using AWS DMS.

**AWS Services**

* Amazon Relational Database Service

**Overview**

To achieve this certificate I had to create a file sharing system for a Pet modelling agency. The agency wanted a way to share Pet images, which could be accessed by many of it's branches.
I used Elastic File System to achieve this and created a mount target for the pet client photos repository. I gained hands on experience working with EFS, and learnt how to centralize storage access to EFS.

**Objectives**

* Evaluate different storage options available on AWS.
* Analyze the key features and benefits of Amazon EFS.
* Apply Amazon EFS solutions to specific business scenarios.
* Configure Amazon EFS endpoints for centralized storage access.

**AWS Services**

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
* Amazon Elastic File System

**Overview**

To achieve this certificate I had to create a network architecture for a bank that controls communication between internal resources and internet using a routing table, internet gateway and a security group.
I gained hands on experience with Amazon VPC's and EC2. I learnt how to configure a VPC, and saw the many components of a VPC.

**Objectives**

* Analyze key components of VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, and route tables.
* Evaluate the advantages of VPC implementations.
* Apply CIDR block notation and IP addressing concepts.
* Configure VPC traffic routing by using gateways, NACLs, and security groups.

**AWS Services**

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
* Amazon VPC
