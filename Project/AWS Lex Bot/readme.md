## Chatbot for AWS Quiz 

**Overview**

For this project we had to build an intercative EC2 knowledge quiz using Amazon Lex. The quiz would be conducted via a bot, of which you can type your responses to and feedback would be given. To create this bot, we created a new bot using Amazon Lex. Then we added an intent (Start Quiz etc..), added uterrances , used responses to give feedback and used simple branching. This ensured a smooth experience with good feedback for the option selected.
