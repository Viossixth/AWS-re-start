## Chatbot for AWS Quiz 

**Overview**

For this project we had to build an intercative EC2 knowledge quiz using Amazon Lex. The quiz would be conducted via a bot, of which you can type your responses to and feedback would be given. To create this bot, we created a new bot using Amazon Lex. Then we added an intent (Start Quiz etc..), added uterrances , used responses to give feedback and used simple branching. This ensured a smooth experience with good feedback for the option selected.

**Challenges & Resolutions**

This project was challenging, because we had an overview of how to create a simple chatbot but the main goal was to expand it and add more questions and logic. We were given the template of a chatbot which you ask questions and answers are provided and we had to create a chatbot for a quiz with feedback integrated. To accomplish this, all team members attempted part 1 of the template and them went on to part two. We had minor scheduling issues but the meetings took place and those absent were informed afterwards. Secodnly figuring out how to integrate Lambda and Lex was an issue for me, requiring hours of research and troubleshooting.A group member finally figured it out, and showed us the working solution. Adding the utterances was easy and configuring Lambda was quick and easy.
