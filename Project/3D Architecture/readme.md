## Project Overview 

The aim of this project was to design infrastructure for an ecommerce application or website which would have 3D Objects of their inventory. AWS services should be used for security, monitoring, performance and scalability. An infrstaructure diagram was drawn showing the various services used and the logical flow of information. A Project brief was written up explaining hwhy each service was chosen and it's function, how the architecture meets the five requirements and any design trade-offs or challenges faced.

## Challenges and Resolutions

This project was very straight-forward as it encompasses all of the knowledge of the AWS ecosystem i have so far, so majority of the work was to reflect and do some further research in order to have accurate information. I was responsible for the second part of the write up where i have to discuss how the chosen services meet the five requirements of High availability, scalability, Performance, Cost Optimization and Security. All I had to do was recollect my knowledge and do some research on each service to ensure accuracy and that i understand the core concept of each service when I write the write up. In terms of time management, I was a bit unwell the week of this project as well as having to fix my AWS re/Start repository and Canvas tasks but I separated the work well, gave myself time to rest and did some well when I felt better. I managed to complete all the tasks in time, and was happy with my effort as well as my teams found it satisfactory.
