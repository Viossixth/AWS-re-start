The aim of this project was to design a static website using html,css and javascript to aid a local restaurant which wants to have a digital footprint and automate some of it's processes. Booking, Ordering and handling of customer data should be automated to increase customer satisfaction, decrease errors when handling orders and ensuring smooth operation of the restaurant. Static website hosting through Amazon S3 was used and to deliver the website to the public as well as other AWS features to strengthen the business operations.
