The aim of this project was to design a static website using html,css and javascript to aid a local restaurant which wants to have a digital footprint and automate some of it's processes. Booking, Ordering and handling of customer data should be automated to increase customer satisfaction, decrease errors when handling orders and ensuring smooth operation of the restaurant. Static website hosting through Amazon S3 was used and to deliver the website to the public as well as other AWS features to strengthen the business operations.

## Challenges and Resolutions 

The first challenge i encountered whilst working on this project was figuring out how to host a website on Amazon S3. Since there should be a live-demo showing how to upload files and enable static website hosting on S3, i had to learn how to do this procvess. Luckily i found AWS Documentation and Turotirals on the following site https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html. The tutorial gave me the steps to follow and even gave me the necessary bucket policy to copy into my bucket for the website to be publicly accessible. A second challenge was configuring the menu and reservation pages/feauture. Another team member wrong most of the code but couldnt get the confirmation to work automatically, he sent it to me and got a fix quite fast and the project went on together. A third challenge was figuring out how we could do the presentation and the tasks we should do. I came up with an idea for 3 people to do present our slides, one person to do the live S3 demo and another team member to showcase the website and explain some of the features and how they were developed. All in all the project was a success, and was a collaborative effort between all five members. We had good coordination, communication and determination to see the project through.
