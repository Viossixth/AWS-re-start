## Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute

Amazon EC2 allows the setting up of virtual servers, called Instances in the AWS Environment. Instances can be configured to match the required workload and can be altered at any time to match the ever changing workloads. Memory, storage, network performance and instance type can be configured. Instances types are differentiated by two things the family and the size. The size can rage from nano to 8X Large and the families are General Purpose, Compute Optimised, Memory optimised, Accelerate optimised and Storage optimised.

When attempting to launch an EC2 instance, an Amazon Machine Image should be chosen, this is a template to start the EC2. It contains the operating system like Winodws or Linux and other supporting applications.AMI's can be provided by AWS, the marketplace , the community or use a custom AMI. 

Storage can be configured with the options of either SSD, HDD , Virtual Magnetic Tapes or Multiple Volumes. These are EBS volumes, and are persistent memory comparable to a Hard drive (Read-only-memory) of a computer.
