## Python Scripting challenge

**Overview**

In this lab, I had to create a python script that displays all prime numbers between 1 to 250, store the results in a results.txt file. 
I further had to test the script and verify that the expected results were received.

Here is the snippet from the Putty Instance. I used Nano to create and edit the python script i created. I ran the script and the results came back as expected.
