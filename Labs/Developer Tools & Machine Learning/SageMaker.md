## Amazon SageMaker - Training a machine-learning model

**Task 1: Accessing a notebook instance in Amazon SageMaker**

To open the Jupyter notebook, I had to log into the AWS Management Console and search for SageMaker AI.
Once I was SageMaker AI I looked for Notebook Instances under the Notebooks tab. I found a notebook named MyNotebook and chose the Open Jupyter Lab

**Task 2: Opening a notebook in your notebook instance**


I selected the language I wanted to use as English(US) on the left. Then I loaded the Jupyter notebook and read through the instructions and ran the code.
I receive a confirmation message at the end, and waited for files to configure. New files appeared on the left.
